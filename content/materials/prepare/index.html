<p>Hello! Welcome to <a href="/">Interactive documents with Shiny</a>, pretty soon we’ll meet for the two day workshop. :bee:</p>
<p>Before seeing me at the workshop, please follow the steps below to make sure everything is installed and ready to go:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>If you haven’t previously used <code>tidyverse</code> packages such as <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a> or <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/">dplyr</a>, learn the basics of data transformation and visualisation. A good resource for this is Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham’s <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/">R for Data Science</a> book.</p></li>
<li><p>Please bring a laptop that has the following installed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A recent version of R (&gt;=3.6.0), which is available for free at <a href="https://cloud.r-project.org/" class="uri">https://cloud.r-project.org/</a></p></li>
<li><p>A recent version of RStudio Desktop (&gt;=1.2), available for free (<a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">RStudio Desktop Open Source License</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>The R packages we will use, which you can install by connecting to the internet, opening RStudio, and running at the command line:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(c(&quot;shiny&quot;, &quot;usethis&quot;, &quot;leaflet&quot;, &quot;plotly&quot;))</code></pre></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>During the workshop I’ll provide instructions on how you can download and set up the course material.</p>
